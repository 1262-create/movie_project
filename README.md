🎬 Movie Recommendation System

🧩 Problem Statement:
With thousands of movies released across genres, languages, and platforms, viewers often struggle to decide what to watch next. Manual searching or relying on general ratings doesn’t always reflect personal taste.
➡️ There is a need for a system that can understand a user's preferences and provide personalized movie recommendations to enhance their viewing experience.

🚀 Project Overview:
This Movie Recommendation System solves the above problem by suggesting movies tailored to user interests. It leverages machine learning techniques like content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to find and recommend relevant films based on similarities in genres, cast, plot, or user behavior.


🔍 Key Features:
🎯 Personalized movie recommendations

🔍 Search functionality to find similar movies by title

🧠 Content-based filtering using movie metadata

🤝 Collaborative filtering using user ratings (optional based on implementation)

📊 Data preprocessing and similarity computation with scikit-learn

🖥️ Web app interface built using Streamlit (or Flask)



🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn / Surprise

Streamlit / Flask (for UI)

Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis

📂 Dataset:
Uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset or MovieLens dataset for training and recommendation logic.

💡 Use Case:
Ideal for streaming platforms or personal entertainment tools where users want quick, relevant, and intelligent suggestions instead of endlessly browsing.
